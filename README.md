**Version**: 1.0.0 (increment the patch/fix version number if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview
City Explorer is a class project. It is a website where a user can provide a city name, which is then parsed and handed over via AXIOS to a third party API (LocationIQ,) to receive information about that city and serve the location of some local food that can be found there.

## Getting Started
<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->
I dunno.

## Architecture
This is a program made in ReactJS, that uses AXIOS for navigating the usage of a third party API. The third party API is LocationIQ, which is used to provide the map results of a city name search query.

## Change Log
<!-- EG:
01-01-2001 4:59pm - Application now has a fully-functional express server, with a GET route for the location resource. -->
